[+] XO Bot -- Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe--

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe (XO) bot that uses the Minimax algorithm to always make the best possible move. The program is divided into four main parts: main : Handles the core game logic and flow. Game : Contains functions responsible for drawing the board and updating the game state. Constants : Stores all the fixed values such as board size, square size, colors, etc. Ai : The “brain” of the bot, implementing the Minimax algorithm to calculate optimal moves.

[+] How to Play

Run the program. You play first and use the O symbol. Click on the square where you want to place your move. The AI (playing as X) will automatically respond with its move. After each move, the AI will display its evaluation in the terminal. The game continues until someone wins or the match ends in a draw. The final result (win, loss, or draw) is shown in the terminal.
